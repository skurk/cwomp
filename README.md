# CWOMP
Simple game for receive-only morse code practice

## Description

CWOMP (CW Old Man Practice) is a single-player game for practicing
the art of head-copying morse code. The game initially offers four
different difficulty settings, varying from 1x1 callsigns (e.g. 'N1E')
to 2x3 with additional suffices (e.g. 'VK7KPR/P')

The cw speed can be set to 15, 18, 20, 23, 25, 28, and 30 wpm.
20 wpm is the default, which is quite comfortable and the speed
I personally recommend both for training and working CW on the air.

## How to play

First, select the speed you're comfortable with. Like I stated above,
20 wpm is a good starting point but you can go slower if you like.

Modify the code if you need to go below 15 wpm.

Next, select the difficulty. Your options are:

Easy (only 1x1): Callsigns like M4A, K8W, F2U, etc. Just three characters,
and if it's your first time, start here.

Beginner (up to 2x2): A mix of 2x2 calls (e.g. LA2T) and 1x1 from the
Easy level.

Medium (up to 2x3): A filthy mix of 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x1, 2x2, and 2x3 calls.

Hard (2x3 + /P, /M etc). Same as Medium, but you'll also get additional
suffices like /P, /M, /MM, etc. So you could get something like OX7CPY/MM.

Finally, click 'Start new game' and the first callsign should play in
your browser.

## Do the head-copy

Enter the callsign you hear in the text box and hit the ENTER key
to submit your answer. This also applies to mobile devices with
on-screen keyboards. Maybe a "Submit" button should've been there,
but meh.

## Scoring

The "Score" label shows your overall total score this session.

Get it right on the first try and you're awarded three points.
Second try, two points. Third and last attempt, one point.
If you didn't get it, the correct callsign will be printed on the
screen but you can keep guessing if you want - although no score
will be added.

The "Claimed" label shows your current score for this round.
This is the potential score that will be added to your total score.

## "Again?" and "Give up"

The "Again?" button will replay the callsign, but also remove one
point from the claimed score this round.

The "Give up" button will yeet you onto the next round, starting over
with a fresh callsign.
