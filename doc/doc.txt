CWOMP - "CW Old Man Practice"

License: GNU GPLv3

This is a hobby project written by yours truly, LB5SH Stian.
A fresh CW operator, as well as a certified grumpy old man.

CWOMP is a simple one-player game that runs entirely in the web browser,
with the goal of practicing head-copying various callsigns in morse code.
You compete against yourself - see how many points you get during the
lunch break or toilet visit. It's surprisingly entertaining, and in my
opinion a great tool for receiving morse code.

As someone who recently started learning CW, hear me out - I'm dead serious:
PLEASE AVOID ALL TOOLS AND TRAINING APPS VISUALIZING CW WITH DOTS AND DASHES!

I'm not kidding. You will end up taking a long detour in the journey of
learning morse code. Trust me, I did this mistake and paid the price.

Anyway, some minor technical details on the game:

Everything is written in oldschool Javascript because I'm old and refuse
to learn new things. All scripts can be found in the 'js' directory.

The base design is in index.html, coupled with the CSS styles from style.css.

The audio samples played are located in the 'audio' directory.

Morse code is generated in realtime using the OscillatorNode supported
by most modern web browsers. Why, I have no idea, but it's there and
I'm using it.

The function for keying morse code was originally written by
Stuart Wakefield and modified to fit this project. His original idea
can be found in this stackoverflow thread:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54096028/repeat-an-audiocontext-oscillator-every-5-seconds

Callsigns are purely random generated, based on a set of rules defined by
the selected difficulty. Check the js/generator.js file for more details.

CWOMP has been tested in Brave, Chrome, and Firefox on desktop.
Only tested in Chrome and Brave on an old Android phone, works fine.

Use in other browsers at your own risk.
